## Problem Statement

Financial institutions face significant risks when borrowers fail to repay loans on time. Identifying potential defaulters early is critical to reducing financial losses, optimizing recovery processes, and ensuring long-term profitability.

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of loan performance, enabling stakeholders to analyze borrower demographics, repayment history, credit scores, and default patterns. By visualizing these factors, the organization can identify high-risk customer segments, monitor portfolio health, and take proactive measures to reduce defaults.

Through dynamic filtering, KPIs, and interactive visuals, the dashboard helps in:

- Detecting trends in default rates across loan types, customer profiles, and regions.

- Analyzing the impact of credit score ranges on default probability.

- Monitoring overdue amounts, recovery percentages, and average repayment delays.




### Steps followed
